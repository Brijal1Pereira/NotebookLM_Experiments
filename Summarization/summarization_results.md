Short-Answer Key
Azure Machine Learning Studio is a cloud-based platform for building, training, and deploying machine learning models. Its key features include data import and preprocessing, model building and evaluation, and deployment capabilities.
Azure Datasets are optimized for large-scale machine learning workflows. They allow users to upload, manage, and explore datasets within Azure Machine Learning, providing tools for data profiling and preprocessing.
AutoML simplifies model building by automating model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering. This reduces manual effort and enables even non-experts to create high-quality machine learning solutions.
Azure Compute Clusters provide scalable resources for running machine learning training jobs. These clusters can scale up or down based on workload, enabling parallel model training and handling large datasets.
LassoLars: A linear regression model employing L1 regularization, beneficial for feature selection and preventing overfitting. * LightGBM: A gradient boosting framework renowned for its speed and efficiency, particularly suitable for extensive datasets. * XGBoostRegressor: Another potent gradient boosting model widely used for regression tasks due to its high accuracy.
Experiment tracking and model metrics allow users to monitor the progress of their experiments, compare various models, and maintain a record of results. This aids in understanding model performance and selecting the most effective model.
The "NYC-Taxi_Fare_Training_Dataset" is used to train and evaluate a machine learning model that predicts taxi fares in New York City based on trip parameters.
Setting up an Automated ML job involves: naming the job and experiment, selecting "Regression" as the task type, specifying "fare_amount" as the target column, defining limits like the maximum number of trials and experiment timeout, and configuring settings like allowed models and featurization options.
The status of an Automated ML job can be checked by navigating to the "Jobs" section in the left panel of Azure Machine Learning Studio. Clicking on the specific job will display its status (e.g., "Completed").
The results of an Automated ML experiment are presented in the "Models + child jobs" tab, where models are ranked by their error metric. The top-performing model, having the lowest error, is typically considered the best. Detailed model metrics and explanations are available for further analysis.
